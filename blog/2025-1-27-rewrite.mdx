## The journey so far...

After a frustrating weekend of [trying to add some new features](../blog/planning-rework), it became apparent the Frag Orders code base is starting to buckle under it's own weight. After 5 years and over 1300 code commits, many of the decisions that were made early on are causing friction when trying to extend and maintain the project. In addition, thanks to our Premium subscribers, we now have some cash flow that can be used to pay for some of the operational costs of a more robust and professional architecture.

Some stats about the size of the project:

## It's time for the rewrite

We have already begun work on what can be thought of as <b>"Frag Orders 2"</b>. This new project will be built using a client-server architecture (original Frag Orders was VERY client-heavy) that will allow for a wider range of new features. Some of these might include:

* **Real-time planning and drawing:** changes to waypoints, radios, drawing, etc can be synced in real time between planners, allowing for a richer planning experience
* **Collaboration and Role-based Access Control:** allow for multiple mission creators to work on the same Frag Order and control access to Frag Orders via Discord roles
* **REST/RPC API:** with a client-server model, data and operations can be opened up for third-party tooling
* **Events, Organizations, and Signups:** this will be a major focus of FO2 enabled by collaboration and role-based access control

These are some of the areas that would have been very difficult in the current architecture, but are somewhat easier if baked into the backend logic from scratch.
