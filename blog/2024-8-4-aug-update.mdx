Lots of new features were released over the summer! Here is an overview of our recent development efforts.

## New Feature: Tacview Object Export

We added the ability to export flight path as a Tacview data object. This can help level-up your debriefing process adding extra geo-spatial context to the tacview file. [Read more about it here](/docs/tacview-export).

## New Module Support

Frag Orders launched support for these new DCS modules:

New Maps:
* Afghanistan
* Kola

Future versions of the Afghanistan map should "just work" without any additional changes, depending on how the map is released in stages.

New Modules:
* OH-58D Kiowa Warrior
* F-4E Phantom

Radios and laser code support have been added to these new modules. There are also some special features in development for the Kiowa related to battlefied graphics.

## New Drawing Objects

In addition, new drawing objects are now supported and visualized in the Frag Order map, including rectangles and ovals.
